# distributed_ether_farm
## Introduction
Decentralized applications: We propose to build a game like FarmVille on blockchains. In the game, each user owns farmland where a user can plant, grow and harvest crops. A user can add friends with another user and steal his/her friend's mature crops. Each crop is represented by a token and can be kept by the user after it's harvested. Users can trade the tokens they have with each other. Additionally, a front end will be implemented to display the status of the farmland, to visualize crops a user has, and to keep track of transaction histories.
