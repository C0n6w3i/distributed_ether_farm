# distributed_ether_farm
## Introduction
Decentralized applications: We propose to build a game like FarmVille on blockchains. In the game, each user owns farmland where a user can plant, grow and harvest crops. A user can add friends with another user and steal his/her friend's mature crops. Each crop is represented by a token and can be kept by the user after it's harvested. Users can trade the tokens they have with each other. Additionally, a front end will be implemented to display the status of the farmland, to visualize crops a user has, and to keep track of transaction histories.
## Methodology

In this project we would like to build a DAPP game to combine traditional business simulation game with blockchain technology.
Thsi project involves environment setup, smart contract development and frontend development.

The basic technique we would implement can be summarized as follows:
    1. we would setup an environment to simulate a chain
    2. we would implement some token based game items, and implement some basic game interactions, such as items exchange, harvesting items. 
    3. we would write a frontend to interact with the smart contract.
### Environment set up:
    we would like to use remix on local full node to test our smart contract with web3.js and frontend
### Smart contract:
    we would like to implement plant, grow and harvest crops, and crops tread
### Frontend:
    we would like to Truffle framework to build the frontend of the game.
